# Introduction - The MNIST Database
The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
The images contain grey levels for each pixel between 0 â€“ 255. The images are already centred in a 28x28 image by computing the centre of mass of the pixels and translating the image so as to position this point at the centre of the 28x28 field.
The training and test labels values are from 0 to 9.
Training and test image pixels are organized row-wise. Pixel values are 0 to 255. 0 means background (white), 255 means foreground (black).
